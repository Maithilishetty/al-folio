Over the past few decades, cruise control systems have been developed to assist the driver while driving long distances.These systems were capable of performing only velocity
control. More recently, automobiles are manufactured with a
more dynamic version of cruise control known as adaptive
cruise control (ACC) which is capable of performing both
velocity and position control. As part of this project, we
developed an adaptive cruise controller with automatic steering
control. The haptic wheel was used as a steering wheel for
the simulated vehicle on the simulink graphics software. The
position of the wheel obtained using quadrature decoding is
used to determine the angle of the front wheels. By toggling
one of the DIP switches, we can enable or disable the ACC
system. When disabled, we can manually control the speed of
the vehicle using the potentiometer. When ACC is enabled,
we use the first 8 DIP switches to set the speed of the vehicle.
As mentioned previously, ACC performs both velocity and
position control. When there is a lead vehicle within the
specified safe distance ahead of our vehicle, position control is
enabled. Otherwise, velocity control is enabled. The automatic
steering control is used to automatically align the vehicle at
the center of the road while performing any speed or velocity
control. The project was modeled entirely in simulink, auto-
code generation was utilized to obtain the C code processed
within S32K144.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

This project was in collaboration with [Adastec Corporation](https://www.adastec.com/) as part of my Techlab @ MCity course. ADASTEC specializes in the delivery of level 4 automated driving software that is ready for real-world transit application. As part of our winter 2022 project, we implemented traffic light recognition using Deep Learning. In particular, we implemented Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 to accomplish this task.

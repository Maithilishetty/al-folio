This project was in collaboration with [Adastec Corporation](https://www.adastec.com/) as part of my Techlab @ MCity course. ADASTEC specializes in the delivery of level 4 automated driving software that is ready for real-world transit application. As part of our winter 2022 project, we implemented traffic light recognition using Deep Learning. 

Traffic light recognition is an important safety feature for autonomous vehicles. In this project, we developed a deep learning model for traffic light recognition using the Faster RCNN and YOLOv4 algorithms.The Faster RCNN algorithm is a popular choice for object detection tasks because it is both accurate and efficient. 
Fr more details on this methods, see [here] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497). For the purpose of training this model, we make use of the Tensorflow object detection API.
YOLOv4, on the other hand, is a newer algorithm that has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a variety of object detection benchmarks. 
To train and evaluate our models, we used the [BOSCH Small Traffic Light Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/content/bosch-small-traffic-lights-dataset).

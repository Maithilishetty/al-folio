I'm a masterâ€™s student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/). 
At present, I am part of the [Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Lab](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/students/) headed by [Dr. Vasileios Tzoumas](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/) working on control theory for autonomous drones. 

Prior to this, I was a Research Intern at the [AI and Robotics Technology Park, IISc](https://www.artpark.in/), where I worked on path planning and manipulation algorithms. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [PES University](https://pes.edu), where I specialized in Signal Processing. 

My broad research interests include robust and intelligent control systems, robotics, reinforcement and machine learning.

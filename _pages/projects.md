**Visual-Inertial SLAM in underwater scenarios** \| [Code](https://github.com/Maithilishetty/Mobile_Robotics_Team22){:target="_blank"}

Tools : ROS, C++, Python\
Researched on the use of SLAM for underwater localization and navigation. Applied several real-time image enhancement techniques resulting in performance improvement of visual-inertial ORB-SLAM3 and OKVIS algorithms.

**Traffic-Light Recognition using Deep Learning** \| [Code](https://github.com/Maithilishetty/Traffic-Light-Recognition){:target="_blank"}

Tools: Python, TensorFlow\
Implemented Faster-RCNN and YOLOv4 to recognize traffic lights on bad weather data provided by Adastec Corp. along with collection of V2X data for sensor fusion done at MCity. Obtained a mAP of 48.79 @ 0.5% using YOLOv4.

**Self Driving Cars: Perception & Control** \| [Code](https://github.com/AdityaSrinivasManohar/ROB-535-Perception-Project){:target="_blank"}

Tools: MATLAB, Python\
Implemented model predictive control for dynamic obstacle avoidance and a YOLOv4 model for vehicle classification from images (1st place on the kaggle and controls leaderboard).

**Design of an Optimal Controller for Effective Radiotherapy**

Languages : MATLAB\
This work aims to design a controller to predict the optimal amount of radiation dosages using the Model Predictive Static Programming (MPSP) method. The work was extended to take into the account the various uncertainties associated with the parameters and applied on the Lotka-Volterra problem.

**Reinforcement Learning Control in Uncertain Systems**

Languages : Python, MATLAB, Simulink\
This work aims to implement the various reinforcement learning strategies in order achieve trajectory tracking of a robot manipulator in the presence of uncertainties such as frictional and torque disturbances. The different strategies include Actor-Critic methods and the Deep Determinsitic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Prior to this, the various startegies are tried and tested on the benchmark Cart-Pole problem which is subjected to frictional and wind disturbances. The GitHub repo for this project will be updated soon!

**Discrete-Time Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator** \| [Code](https://github.com/Maithilishetty/UDE-DiscreteTime){:target="_blank"}

Languages : MATLAB, Simulink \
This original work attempts to extend the concept of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) to the discrete-time domain wherein a
discrete-time robust control law based on UDE has been derived. Numerical simulations have also been performed to validate the efficacy of the control algorithm. Extended work on the use of observers for state estimation applied to a two-link robot manipulator.
